# miPs
Coexpression analysis of microProteins (cis and trans miPs) and their target was performed based on Pearson correlation coefficient analysis (PCC). RNASeq dataset from rice anatomical samples were used as source for coexpression prediction. RNASeq normalized expression count table for miPs and their target is provided as csv files, in which miPs and their targets are represented in alternative rows below the row containing sample name. The python script 'pcc.py' was used to estimate the PCC from these RNASeq datasets.
